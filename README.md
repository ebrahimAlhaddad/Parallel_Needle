## Project Report is in Master above

- Parallel computation test with diagonal traversal is in the "diagonalTraversal" branch

- Purely serial implementation test is in the "VenillaSerial" branch

- Matrix initialization with four threads dedicated for different tasks is in the "pInitialMatrix" branch

- Matrix initialization with the blocking technique is in the "initMatrixBlockStyle" branch

## Each branch has instructions in their readme.md
